# Dijkstra-Bus-Travel-Optimizer

This Java program utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to help you find the minimum amount of time needed to reach each bus station in a location. With multiple buses and stations, the program optimizes your travel by identifying the most efficient routes.


## Introduction

In any location, there are N bus stations and M buses providing services. Each bus has a schedule consisting of t stations. Passengers start at station 1 and can board a bus when it arrives at the same station. You can get off the bus at any station. Buses continuously circulate through their schedules.

## Features

- Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the minimum travel time to each bus station.
- Support for multiple buses, stations, and schedules.
- Effortless travel optimization by selecting the most efficient bus routes.
- Clear and extensible Java codebase.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Compile and run the Java program using your preferred Java development environment.

3. Follow the prompts to input the necessary parameters and calculate the minimum travel time.

## Usage

To use the Dijkstra-Bus-Travel-Optimizer, follow these steps:

1. Run the Java program.

2. Input the number of stations (N) and buses (M).

3. Define the schedules for each bus, specifying the number of stations they visit.

4. The program will calculate and display the minimum travel time to reach each bus station.

## Input Format
The input format includes:

- The number of stations (N) and buses (M).
- Schedules for each bus, indicating the number of stations visited and their order.
